** Project Description **

The O*net database is a widely used source of information about occupations in the United States.

Two well-known disadvantages of the database are its size--each occupation in the database has
hundreds of measured features, many of which are somewhat correlated--and its lack of validation
in the labor market. For example, two occupations may appear to be very similar in terms
of the features measured in the O*net but are not actually close substitutes in the
real world.

The goal of this project is to make the O*net easier to explore to address the first of these concerns.

This explorer consists of three components:

First, a method for matching an input query to an occupation in the database. In the first iteration,
this match is based on job titles.

Second, a weighted nearest-neighbors method for identifying similar occupations.

Third, a dimension reduction method for visualization.
